<h1>ATMega328 Code</h1>

This is the working directory for all code written for the Atmel ATMega328 microcontroller. 

Note: All the makefiles in this directory were written with the assumption an usbasp programmer is being used to flash code to the chip. The makefiles must be edited for the code here to properly upload to the microcontroller if another programmer is used.
